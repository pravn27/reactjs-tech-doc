## key points

- Make sure maintain **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** in each components of complete react projects, meaning each components should do one thing, and do it well, this helps keep components clean, reusable, and easy to test and maintain.
- If a single component is handling multiple responsibilities or tasks, refactor it by splitting those tasks into separate components. This ensures each component adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). So that maintain code in modular fashion
- **Modular Design**: Organize your codebase by dividing it into small, logical modules. This enhances maintainability and testability, making your application easier to manage and scale. Modular design also simplifies debugging, as issues can be isolated and resolved more efficiently during unit testing.
- By adhering to **Modular Design** and the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** in your projects, you gain several advantages:
  - **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused across different parts of your application.
  - **Maintainability**: Code is easier to update, refactor, and debug.
  - **Testability**: Smaller, focused components are simpler to test in isolation.
