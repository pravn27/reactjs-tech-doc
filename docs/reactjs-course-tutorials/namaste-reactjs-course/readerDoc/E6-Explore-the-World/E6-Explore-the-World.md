## key points

- **Monolithic architecture vs Microservices architecture**

  - **Monolithic architecture**: A single, unified application that contains all the necessary components and services. It is easier to develop and maintain, but can become difficult to scale and update.
    Example: A single web application that handles all the functionality, such as user authentication, data storage, and API calls.
  - **Microservices architecture**: A distributed system that consists of multiple smaller, independent services that work together to provide a complete application. Each service is responsible for a specific functionality and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
    Example: A web application that consists of multiple microservices, such as a user authentication service, a data storage service, and an API service.
