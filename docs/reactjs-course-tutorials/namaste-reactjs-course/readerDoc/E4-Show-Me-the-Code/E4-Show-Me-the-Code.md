## key points

- **Planning** - Before building any real time web apps from scratch, planning is very important about How to build ? What to build ? Why to build ? and how to build it in a better way.
  - Never start blindly writing code without any planning. It's like building a house without any plan. It's not possible.
  - High level planning what to build, kind of prototyping, and then start writing code.
- HLD (High level design of Food App)
