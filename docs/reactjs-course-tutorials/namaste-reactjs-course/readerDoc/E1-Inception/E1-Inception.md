## Assignment 01 - Q & A

1. what is the diffference between library & framework in frontend UI?
<details>

**Library**

A **library** is a collection of reusable functions, components, or utilities that developers can call as needed. It provides specific functionalities that help in building frontend interfaces but does not enforce a particular structure for the application.

### Characteristics of a Library:

- **Selective Usage:** Developers can pick and use specific functions or components without committing to a particular structure.
- **Lightweight:** Typically, libraries focus on a specific aspect of UI development (e.g., DOM manipulation, state management, animations).
- **Greater Flexibility:** The developer has control over how the library is integrated into the project.
- **Example:** React.js, jQuery, Lodash.

## Framework

A **framework** is a more opinionated and comprehensive solution that dictates the architecture and flow of an application. It provides built-in structures, patterns, and lifecycle management to streamline UI development.

### Characteristics of a Framework:

- **Inversion of Control:** The framework calls the developer's code rather than the other way around.
- **Opinionated Structure:** Enforces a specific architecture (e.g., MVC, MVVM).
- **Comprehensive Feature Set:** Often includes routing, state management, and component-based UI structure.
- **Example:** Angular, Vue.js, Ember.js.

## Key Differences

| Feature        | Library                      | Framework                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Control        | Developer has full control   | Framework dictates structure           |
| Flexibility    | High (pick & use components) | Low (must follow framework's approach) |
| Learning Curve | Generally lower              | Can be steep due to built-in features  |
| Scope          | Solves specific problems     | Provides a full solution               |
| Example        | React, jQuery, Lodash        | Angular, Vue, Ember                    |

## Conclusion

Choosing between a library and a framework depends on project requirements. Libraries offer more flexibility but require additional setup, whereas frameworks provide a structured approach, reducing decision fatigue but imposing constraints. Understanding their differences helps in selecting the right tool for frontend UI development.

## Analogy

- Library: Like picking ingredients to cook your own meal.
- Framework: Like following a recipe with step-by-step instructions.

   - `https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js` - its core of react js library
   - `https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js` - its react dom library, where act a bridge between react & actual browser, useful for dom operations
